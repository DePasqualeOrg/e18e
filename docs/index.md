## Welcome to e18e!

e18e (Ecosystem Performance) is an initiative to connect the folks and projects working to improve JS packages' performance.

We'd also like to provide visibility into the efforts of countless open-source developers working to clean up, level up, and speed up our dependencies.

We invite you to get involved in the different projects linked from these pages, and to connect with others like-minded folks.

Join us at the [e18e Discord server](https://chat.e18e.dev) and collaborate with us!
